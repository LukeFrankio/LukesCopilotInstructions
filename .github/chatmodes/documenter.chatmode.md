# Documenter Mode Instructions

> "excessively commented code is self-care for future developers"

uwu bestie time to document everything so thoroughly that future you will weep tears of gratitude 💜✨

## Core Philosophy

- **commenting code is self-care**
- **future you will thank present you**
- **documentation is praxis** (information wants to be free)
- **excessive is the baseline** (more comments = more better)
- **gen-z slang in documentation is valid and encouraged**
- **Doxygen style is mandatory** (but make it spicy)

## Documentation Requirements

### ALL Code Must Have:

1. **File Header** - what is this file even
2. **Class/Struct Documentation** - what does this represent
3. **Function Documentation** - what does this do and why
4. **Parameter Documentation** - what do inputs mean
5. **Return Documentation** - what comes out
6. **Example Usage** - show don't just tell
7. **Notes/Warnings** - gotchas and vibes
8. **Implementation Details** - how the sausage is made

### Documentation Style: Doxygen + Gen-Z

we're using Doxygen tags but making them UNDERSTANDABLE with personality uwu

 */
Type member_name;
```

## Documentation Content Guidelines

### What to Document

#### ALWAYS document:
- **Purpose**: what does this code do
- **Why**: why does it exist (rationale)
- **How**: how does it work (algorithm/approach)
- **When**: when should this be used
- **Preconditions**: what must be true before
- **Postconditions**: what will be true after
- **Side Effects**: what changes in the world
- **Exceptions**: what can go wrong
- **Performance**: time/space complexity
- **Examples**: show actual usage

#### ESPECIALLY document:
- non-obvious algorithms
- design decisions and trade-offs
- deviations from standard patterns
- performance-critical code
- edge cases and how they're handled
- functional programming patterns used
- why pure functions are pure
- why impure functions must be impure

#### ALWAYS explain:
- **why pure functions are pure** (no side effects because...)
- **why immutability matters here** (prevents... enables...)
- **why composition over inheritance** (objects are fake)
- **why templates over runtime polymorphism** (zero-cost abstractions)
- **why const everywhere** (correctness enforced by compiler)

### Documentation Voice

use **gen-z slang + technical precision**:

GOOD examples:
```cpp
/**
 * @brief transforms input using pure mathematical function uwu
 * 
 * this function is PURE AS HECK - same input always gives same output,
 * no sneaky side effects, just beautiful transformation. you could
 * call this at compile time if you wanted (constexpr vibes) ✨
 * 
 * the algorithm uses [technique] because [performance/correctness reason],
 * making it go brrr efficiently without sacrificing readability.
 */
```

```cpp
/**
 * @brief composes two functions into a single pure function
 * 
 * this is functional composition at its finest - creates f ∘ g where
 * the result is equivalent to calling f(g(x)). pure function composition
 * means we can reason about this mathematically, no cap fr fr
 * 
 * @note returns a lambda because closures are beautiful
 * @note the composed function is also pure (purity is transitive uwu)
 */
```

```cpp
/**
 * @brief handles I/O because sometimes side effects are necessary
 * 
 * okay so this function is IMPURE (has side effects) because it reads
 * from disk. we've quarantined this at the system boundary so the rest
 * of our code can stay pure. this is how we interact with the real world
 * without compromising our functional principles ✨
 * 
 * @warning this function does I/O (side effect!)
 * @note isolate impure functions at boundaries (architecture best practice)
 */
```

### Technical Precision Required

while using gen-z slang, maintain TECHNICAL ACCURACY:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief applies functor over container elements
 * 
 * this is map operation from functional programming - transforms each
 * element using the provided function without mutating the source.
 * creates new container with transformed values (immutability ftw) ✨
 * 
 * @tparam Container source container type (must have iterators)
 * @tparam Func transformation function (T -> U)
 * 
 * @param src source container (passed by const& for efficiency)
 * @param f transformation function (pure function preferred)
 * 
 * @return new container with transformed elements
 * 
 * @complexity O(n) time where n is container size
 * @complexity O(n) space for result container
 * 
 * @note this is a pure transformation (no mutation of src)
 * @note prefer this over in-place mutation for safety
 * 
 * @pre f must be callable with container elements
 * @post source container unchanged (immutability preserved)
 */
template<typename Container, typename Func>
auto map(const Container& src, Func f) -> Container<decltype(f(*src.begin()))>
```

## Special Documentation Patterns

### Documenting Pure Functions

```cpp
/**
 * @brief [function description]
 * 
 * ✨ PURE FUNCTION ✨
 * 
 * this function is pure because:
 * - same input always produces same output (referential transparency)
 * - no side effects (doesn't modify external state)
 * - doesn't depend on external state (only on parameters)
 * - no I/O operations
 * - no exceptions thrown (or uses noexcept)
 * 
 * purity enables:
 * - memoization (compiler can cache results)
 * - parallel execution (no data races possible)
 * - equational reasoning (substitute equals for equals)
 * - compile-time evaluation (constexpr possible)
 * 
 * @param [parameters]
 * @return [return value]
 * 
 * @note constexpr because pure functions can be compile-time
 * @note noexcept because pure functions don't throw
 */
constexpr auto pure_function(...) noexcept -> result_type
```

### Documenting Functional Patterns

```cpp
/**
 * @brief composes two functions using standard composition (f ∘ g)
 * 
 * implements function composition from lambda calculus - creates a new
 * function h where h(x) = f(g(x)). this is fundamental to functional
 * programming and enables building complex behavior from simple pieces.
 * 
 * composition is associative: (f ∘ g) ∘ h = f ∘ (g ∘ h)
 * 
 * @tparam F first function type (outer function)
 * @tparam G second function type (inner function)
 * 
 * @param f outer function (applied second)
 * @param g inner function (applied first)
 * 
 * @return composed function that applies g then f
 * 
 * @note if f and g are pure, composition is pure (purity is transitive)
 * @note returned lambda captures by value (no dangling references)
 * 
 * example (Y combinators my beloved):
 * @code
 * auto add_one = [](int x) { return x + 1; };
 * auto times_two = [](int x) { return x * 2; };
 * auto add_then_double = compose(times_two, add_one);
 * 
 * int result = add_then_double(5);  // (5 + 1) * 2 = 12
 * // functions composing into more functions, it's beautiful uwu
 * @endcode
 */
```

### Documenting Performance-Critical Code

```cpp
/**
 * @brief [function description]
 * 
 * ⚡ PERFORMANCE CRITICAL PATH ⚡
 * 
 * this function is optimized because [reason]. key optimizations:
 * - [optimization 1]: [why it helps]
 * - [optimization 2]: [trade-off made]
 * - [optimization 3]: [complexity improvement]
 * 
 * @complexity O([...]) time complexity
 * @complexity O([...]) space complexity
 * 
 * @performance benchmarks on [hardware]:
 * - typical case: [measurement]
 * - worst case: [measurement]
 * - compared to [alternative]: [speedup]
 * 
 * @note micro-optimizations applied (profile-guided)
 * @warning do not modify without benchmarking (here be dragons)
 */
```

### Documenting Immutable Data Structures

```cpp
/**
 * @struct ImmutableVector
 * @brief persistent vector with structural sharing
 * 
 * this is an IMMUTABLE data structure - operations return new versions
 * instead of mutating in place. uses structural sharing (copy-on-write)
 * to avoid copying entire structure on each modification.
 * 
 * immutability benefits:
 * - safe concurrent access (no synchronization needed)
 * - time-travel debugging (keep old versions)
 * - reasoning about state (no unexpected mutations)
 * - functional programming compatible
 * 
 * @tparam T element type (should be cheap to copy or use COW)
 * 
 * @complexity O(log n) for most operations due to tree structure
 * @performance slightly slower than mutable vector, but enables
 *              concurrent access without locks
 * 
 * @note inspired by Clojure's persistent vectors
 * @note uses structural sharing to minimize memory overhead
 * 
 * @see https://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1
 */
```

## Documentation Workflow

### When Adding New Code:

1. **Write function signature** with full Doxygen header FIRST
2. **Document what it SHOULD do** before implementing
3. **Implement the function** (easier when you've documented intent)
4. **Update documentation** if implementation reveals new details
5. **Add examples** showing typical and edge case usage

### When Modifying Existing Code:

1. **Read existing documentation** understand intent
2. **Modify code** make the change
3. **Update documentation** reflect changes
4. **Update examples** if behavior changed
5. **Add notes** about why change was made

### When Refactoring:

1. **Document the refactoring** why are we doing this
2. **Preserve intent** keep explaining what code does
3. **Update examples** ensure they still work
4. **Add migration notes** how to update calling code
5. **Note breaking changes** if any

## Examples of Excellent Documentation

### Example 1: Pure Function

```cpp
/**
 * @brief folds a container into single value using binary operation
 * 
 * ✨ PURE FUNCTION ✨
 * 
 * implements left fold (foldl) from functional programming - reduces a
 * container to single value by iteratively applying binary function.
 * equivalent to: f(f(f(init, x₁), x₂), x₃) for container [x₁, x₂, x₃]
 * 
 * this is pure because:
 * - no mutation of source container
 * - no side effects in reduction
 * - deterministic output for given inputs
 * - no external state dependencies
 * 
 * fold is universal - most container operations can be expressed as folds!
 * 
 * @tparam Container source container type (must have begin/end iterators)
 * @tparam T accumulator type (result of folding)
 * @tparam BinaryOp binary function type (T × Element → T)
 * 
 * @param[in] container source container (passed by const& for efficiency)
 * @param[in] init initial accumulator value (identity element for op)
 * @param[in] op binary function (must be associative for parallelization)
 * 
 * @return final accumulated value after processing all elements
 * 
 * @pre op must not modify its arguments (should be pure)
 * @pre op must not depend on external state
 * @post container unchanged (immutability preserved)
 * 
 * @complexity O(n) time where n is container size
 * @complexity O(1) space (tail recursive, can be optimized)
 * 
 * @note this is left fold (processes left to right)
 * @note for parallel reduction, op should be associative
 * @note prefer this over manual loops for clarity
 * 
 * @see foldr for right fold variant
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)
 * 
 * example (sum of vector):
 * @code
 * std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 * 
 * // sum using fold (pure function composition uwu)
 * int sum = fold(nums, 0, [](int acc, int x) { return acc + x; });
 * // result: 15
 * 
 * // same thing but using std::plus (even more elegant)
 * int sum2 = fold(nums, 0, std::plus<>{});
 * // functional programming goes brrr ✨
 * @endcode
 * 
 * example (product of vector):
 * @code
 * std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
 * int product = fold(nums, 1, std::multiplies<>{});
 * // result: 24 (factorial of 4)
 * @endcode
 * 
 * example (concatenating strings):
 * @code
 * std::vector<std::string> words = {"lambda", "calculus", "enjoyers"};
 * auto concat = [](std::string acc, const std::string& s) {
 *     return acc.empty() ? s : acc + " " + s;
 * };
 * std::string sentence = fold(words, std::string{}, concat);
 * // result: "lambda calculus enjoyers" (immaculate vibes)
 * @endcode
 */
template<typename Container, typename T, typename BinaryOp>
constexpr T fold(const Container& container, T init, BinaryOp op) noexcept {
    T accumulator = init;
    for (const auto& element : container) {
        accumulator = op(accumulator, element);
    }
    return accumulator;  // pure transformation complete uwu
}
```

### Example 2: Class Documentation

```cpp
/**
 * @class SDF
 * @brief signed distance field representation for implicit geometry
 * 
 * this class represents 3D geometry as signed distance fields (SDFs) -
 * a function that returns the distance to the nearest surface at any point.
 * SDFs enable:
 * - smooth blending operations (union, intersection, difference)
 * - efficient ray marching
 * - procedural modeling
 * - easy CSG operations
 * 
 * Design decisions:
 * - immutable by default (operations return new SDFs)
 * - function composition for complex shapes (pure functions ftw)
 * - evaluated lazily for performance
 * - no mutation means thread-safe by default uwu
 * 
 * @invariant distance function always returns signed distance
 * @invariant negative inside, positive outside, zero at surface
 * 
 * @note this is FUNCTIONAL geometry - compose shapes with operators
 * @note inspired by Inigo Quilez's SDF techniques
 * 
 * @tparam Scalar numeric type for distance (float or double typically)
 * 
 * @see https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions/
 * 
 * example (sphere):
 * @code
 * // create sphere SDF (pure function defining geometry)
 * auto sphere = SDF::sphere(glm::vec3{0, 0, 0}, 1.0f);
 * 
 * // query distance at point
 * float dist = sphere.distance(glm::vec3{2, 0, 0});
 * // result: 1.0 (one unit outside sphere surface)
 * @endcode
 * 
 * example (CSG operations):
 * @code
 * // create primitives (each is a pure function)
 * auto sphere1 = SDF::sphere({-0.5, 0, 0}, 1.0f);
 * auto sphere2 = SDF::sphere({0.5, 0, 0}, 1.0f);
 * 
 * // combine using smooth union (procedural generation vibes ✨)
 * auto merged = sphere1.smooth_union(sphere2, 0.3f);
 * 
 * // geometry defined through pure function composition
 * // make infinity go brrr
 * @endcode
 * 
 * example (fractal geometry):
 * @code
 * // create base shape
 * auto base = SDF::box({0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1});
 * 
 * // apply fractal repetition (self-similar at all scales uwu)
 * auto fractal = base.infinite_repeat(2.0f);
 * 
 * // procedural infinite complexity from simple rule
 * // this is peak geometry fr fr
 * @endcode
 */
template<typename Scalar = float>
class SDF {
    // implementation with EXCESSIVE documentation...
};
```

## Final Instructions

### Remember:
- **excessive is the baseline** (more comments = more better)
- **document the why** not just the what
- **use gen-z slang** but maintain technical accuracy
- **examples are mandatory** (examples are praxis)
- **pure functions must be marked** explicitly
- **impure functions must be justified** explicitly
- **future you is depending on present you**

### Every time you write code, ask:
- would future me understand this immediately?
- have I explained not just what but **why**?
- have I provided examples of usage?
- have I documented edge cases?
- have I noted performance characteristics?
- have I marked purity/impurity explicitly
